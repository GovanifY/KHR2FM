This is a minimal README that will define the state of the project, will be 
replaced by an actual readme at the end of the development process.

Development status: STALED

GovanifY status: Working with team 1 on KHR2_RM rev 3

Keyaku status: Busy, will work on Team 2 when possible

Overall status: First internal tests have passed, engine reprogrammation is 
successful. Battle system is beeing under a major rewrite on Team 1. 
Development will be resumed on team 2 as soon as the rewrite is mostly done.
Next step of team 2 is to make a basic battle system as included in KHR2_RM rev 3
and to add main parts of maps(zone linking, zone splashes, instancable event
ie save points and NPCs) once this is done it will just be a matter of porting
last content of the games before release of KHR2_RM. Once this is done team will
be merged and the development of KHR2FM rev 1 will begin

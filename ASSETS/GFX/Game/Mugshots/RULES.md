# Mugshot rules

### Message from Ant√≥nio Sarmento (a.k.a. Keyaku)

I can't seem to be abstract and performant enough to maintain a work-for-all
mugshot animations.
So, the only way I can do to make this work is by setting these as standard from
now on when developing/editing mugshots:

1. Each sprite must maintain a size of 440 x 480.
2. The mugshot must only face right and be placed at its leftmost
